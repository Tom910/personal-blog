  description:
    "I started developing for companies in 2012 and have seen the Web world before React, TS and current toolings set. During this time I have seen several generations of changes in the Web. In recent years, I have worked in a platform team that develops technical products for WEB developers and has supported a busy site in production using SSR with React. As a result, I got a lot of experience around performance, product development of internal solutions, SRE and development of large sites with 100+ developers",
